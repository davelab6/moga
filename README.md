Moga
====

Moga is a libre font development project. Currently, this ongoing work intends to support both the Gurmukhi and the Latin scripts. Moga will be made available, libre and gratis, at Google Fonts. 

<h2>Files</h2>
Two folders are hosted here: <em>Moga Font Files</em> and <em>Moga Source Files</em>. The font files folder will eventuall contain both PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts (.otf) and TrueType-flavored fonts (.ttf). The .ttf-files will be auto-hinted with ttfautohint version 1.3. All of the font files will be generated with the Glyphs 2 font editing application. The source files folder will contain a native Glyphs file as well a UFO file exported from Glyphs.

All files are offered as-is.
