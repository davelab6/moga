Moga
====

Moga is a libre font development project. Currently, this ongoing work intends to support both the Gurmukhi and the Latin scripts. Moga will be made available, libre and gratis, at Google Fonts. The font is in the style of informal, unconnected handwriting. However, all of the letters are still “typographically informed.”

<h2>Files</h2>
Several folders will be hosted here: <em>releases</em>, <em>sources</em>, and a <em>test</em> folder. The releases folder will eventually contain both PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts (.otf) and TrueType-flavored fonts (.ttf). The .ttf-files will be auto-hinted with ttfautohint version 1.3. All of the font <em>releases</em> will be generated from <em>sources</em> that are files for the Glyphs 2 font editing application. The sources files folder will eventually also contain a UFO file exported from Glyphs, too. The <em>test</em> folder contains PDF files, and the .otf files used to set them.

All files are offered as-is, but support is available on request.
